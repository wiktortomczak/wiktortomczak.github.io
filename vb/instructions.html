<h1>Instructions</h1>


<p>
To generate balanced teams, with team-average player ratings as close as possible:

<ol>
<li>Add players to the game<br/>
    (<button>Add players from CSV</button> button in the players panel left).
<li>Fill teams automatically<br/>
    (<button>Fill teams ...</button> buttons in the teams panel top right).

<br/>
and optionally

<li>Balance teams automatically<br/>
  (<button>Balance teams</button> button in the teams panel top right).
</ol>
</p>

<p>
Manual adjustments are possible at any step:

<ul>
<li>Seed / partially prefill teams with selected players.
<li>Automatically fill (complete) partially filled teams.
<li>Move players between teams / back to unassigned.
<li>Add more players / remove players from the game.
<li>Restart / change number of teams.
</ul>

All steps can be done any number of times in any order.
</p>

<p>
In addition, it is possible to:

<ul>
<li>Mark as captain one player per team .
<li>Pin players to the team, so that they are not moved when auto-balancing teams.
</ul>
</p>



<h2>Actions (selected)</h2>

<h3>Add players to the game</h3>

In the players panel:

<ol>
<li>In the CSV input, enter any number of text lines in the format:

<pre>
player name, player rating
</pre>

eg. (cut & paste to test)

<pre>
Joe Smith,10
John Doe,5
</pre>

<li>Click <button>Add players from CSV</button>.
</ol>

A new player will appear in the players panel for each correctly formatted line.<br/>
Badly formatted lines will be left in the CSV input.

<h3>Move players between teams / back to unassigned</h3>

<ol>
<li>In the source players or team panel, click (select) a player to be moved.
<li>In the target players or team panel, click <button>Add</button>.<br/>
    Once a player is selected, they will appear as candidate in the last row of every other panel.
</ol>

Alternatively

<ol>
<li>In the source players or team panel, hover over a player to be moved.
<li>Click one of <button>1</button><button>2</button><button>3</button><button>4</button><button>5</button><button>6</button>.<br/>
    The buttons will appear once the mouse hovers over the player.
</ol>

<h3>Mark player as captain / pin player / unpin player</h3>

<ol>
<li>In the player's team panel, hover over a player, then click <button>Captain</button> or <button>Pin</button>. The captain is automatically pinned.<br/>
    The buttons will appear once the mouse hovers over the player.
</ol>

<h2>Fill / balance algorithms</h2>

<h3>Fill teams randomly</h3>
Unassigned players are chosen at random, one at a time, and added to the team
with the lowest number of players (to one of such teams chosen at random if
there is more than one).

<h3>Fill teams strongest first</h3>
Unassigned players are chosen in order of rating (highest rating first)
and added to the team with the lowest number of players and the lowest average
rating (first such team if there is more than one).

<h3>Balance teams</h3>
Pairs of players from different teams are chosen at random and swapped if
it gives more balanced teams, as measured by balance score: team-average rating
range. Pinned players are not swapped. Balancing runs for a limited number of swaps.
