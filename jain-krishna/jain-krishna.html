This is a model of autocatalytic sets and their evolution as described in
[<a href="https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.81.5684">1</a>];
reimplementation and visualization.
      </p>
      <h3>1. Model</h3>
      <h4>1.1. Components</h4>
      <p>
The model consists of
        <ul>
          <li>A set of <var>s</var> distinct chemical species (molecule types),
              eventually forming <a href="#autocatalytic_set">autocatalytic sets</a>.
          <li>Catalytic interactions (relations) between some pairs of species,
              such that one species catalytically produces the other species,
              assigned randomly with probability <var>m</var>.
          <li>A sequence of successive time steps, each with a new particular set
              of species and catalytic interactions, evolved from previous time
              steps according to the <a href="#mutations">update rule</a>.
        </ul>
The species differ only by their catalytic interactions and are otherwise
uniform. The interactions are assigned at random every time a species is
introduced, that is, at model initialization or to replace another species
due to the <a href="#mutations">update rule</a>. The model state is entirely
described by <var>s</var>&times;<var>s</var> catalytic interaction matrices,
one per time step.
      </p>
      <h4 id="autocatalytic_set">1.2. Autocatalytic set</h4>
      <p>
An <dfn>autocatalytic set</dfn> (ACS) is a set of species in which each species is
catalytically produced by some other species in the set. For example, a minimal
ACS is the 2-cycle A&nbsp;&rlarr;&nbsp;B, where A catalyses B and B catalyses A.
Thus, as a whole, the set of species (re)produces itself (is autocatalytic),
even though individual species alone do not. 
      </p>
      <p>
An ACS always contains a cycle of species linked via catalytic interactions.
Depending on their location with respect to the cycle, species are classified as:
        <ul>
          <li><dfn>core</dfn> - ACS species in the cycle
          <li><dfn>shadow</dfn> - ACS species catalyzed transitively by
            (reachable from) species in the cycle
          <li><dfn>background</dfn> - non-ACS species, not catalyzed (unreachable)
        </ul>
      </p>
      <h4>1.3. Visualization</h4>
      <p>
The model at a given time step is visualized as a graph: species as nodes,
catalytic interactions as directed links. Numbers in nodes indicate particular
species, designated 1..<var>s</var>. ACSs are shown by coloring core and shadow
species with <span class="core">green</span> and <span class="shadow">orange</span>,
respectively. A set of controls below the graph allows to scroll through all time
steps. Other model <a href="#properties">properties</a> are shown in separate
charts.
      </p>
      <p>
        <img src="species_graph.png" />
In the above example, the graph shows the model at time step 600. The are two
ACSs: {0 (core), 49 (core), 2 (shadow), 3 (shadow)}, {1 (core), 86 (core), 4 (shadow)}.
      </p>
      <h4 id="properties">1.4. Properties</h4>
      <p>
In each time step, the catalytic interactions determine a number of descriptive
properties of the species-interactions system, related primarily to ACSs:
        <ul>
          <li>presence of ACSs, their size
          <li>classification of species into core, shadow, background
          <li>number of catalytic links
          <li>&lambda;&#8321; (see [<a href="https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.81.5684">1</a>])
          <li>size of the dominant ACS
        </ul>
The ACSs are shown in the species graph for the currently selected time step.
Other properties are in separate timeseries charts, showing their evolution
across all time steps.
      </p>
      <h4 id="parameters">1.5. Parameters</h4>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>number of species <var>s</var>
          <li>average number <var>m</var> of catalytic interactions between
             given species and other species; <br/>
             <var>m</var> = <var>p(s-1)</var>, where <var>p</var>
             - probability of interaction between given two species
        </ul>
      </p>
      <h4 id="mutations">1.6. Mutations of the least fit species</h4>
      <p>
After each time step, exactly one species is replaced by a new species;
the old species' catalytic interactions with other species are removed
and the new species' interactions are assigned at random, again.
      </p>
      <p>
The species replaced is the least fit species, one with the lowest
<a href="#concentration">molecular concentration</a>. 
      </p>
      <h4 id="concentration">1.7. Species concentration</h4>
      <p>
Relative molecular concentrations of all species are fully determined by the
structure of catalytic interactions, regardless of their previous concentrations
(due to previous interactions). The concentrations are computed, but not shown,
in each time step.
      </p>
      <h3>2. Evolution of autocatalytic sets</h3>
      <p>
The model demonstrates the emergence and growth of autocatalytic sets,
from an initial pool of random chemical species without any such set.
      </p>
      <h4>2.1. Evolution phases</h4>
      <p>
In the course of model evolution, an ACS
        <ol>
          <li>inevitably (1) emerges (end of <i>random phase</i>)
          <li>grows, until it (2) contains all species (<i>growth phase</i>)
          <li>continues to improve stability and efficiency (<i>organization phase</i>)
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p>
The above three phases, separated by the phase transition points (1), (2) are
easily found in the charts:

      </p>
      <h4>2.2. Characteristics</h4>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>The appearance and growth of ACSs is inevitable.
          <li>During the growth phase, the increase in number of catalytic links is exponential.
          <li>The all-species graph at the end of the growth phase is highly non-random.
        </ul>
      </p>
      <h4>2.3. Explanation</h4>
      <p>
The appearance of a minimal ACS is by chance and is, given enough time steps,
inevitable for any <var>m</var>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;0, because it has a finite
non-zero probability.
      </p>
      <p>
The growth of ACSs to all species is inevitable because as long as
a smaller-than-all-species ACS exists, the <a href="#mutations">update rule</a>
replaces a non-ACS species, and the new species can join the ACS with again
non-zero probability. The replaced species is a non-ACS species because
in presence of an ACS, the relative concentrations of non-ACS species are orders
of magnitude lower than those of ACS species, as the latter grow much faster
(exponentially) in a positive catalytic feedback loop.
      </p>
      <p>
        (see [<a href="https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.81.5684">1</a>] for more details)
      </p>
      <h3>3. Self-organization and complexity</h3>
      <p>
The forming and growth of ACS is an example of self-organizating complexity,
not prescribed by but emergent from the lower-level model mechanics (the
<a href="#mutations">update rule</a>). The complexity of an ACS grows
exponentially, as measured by the number of catalytic interactions (links).
This is even though the average number of links of a new species is the same
as was that of the replaced species, initially.
